# Neural-Network-Tutorial
## neural network in C++

This small project is implementaion simple neural network in c++, which is based on the [Neural Net in C++ Tutorial](https://vimeo.com/19569529) by David Miller.

## Test in Visual Studio
The project is implemented to model a predictor to solve XOR logic problem and developed in visual studio 2019. 
After feeding around 700 training data, the model successfully make a correct prediction on result.
